      <h3>A beginners guide to League of Legends</h3>
      <p>
        League of Legends (LoL) is a fast-paced strategy game where two teams of
        five players each, aim to destroy the opposing team's nexus, located
        within their base. Players start by choosing a champion, each with
        unique abilities. Once the game begins, earn gold by killing enemy
        units, and use it to buy items and boost your champion's power. The game
        map is divided into lanes, where most of the combat happens, and a
        jungle area filled with neutral monsters for additional resources.
        Teamwork, strategy, and quick decision-making are key to winning in LoL.

            'Summoner's Rift' is the classic, competitive mode of League of
            Legends. In this 5v5 mode, two teams strive to destroy the enemy's
            nexus, located at the heart of their base. The map features three
            lanes - top, mid, and bot, along with a jungle filled with monsters.
            Strategic planning, timely execution, and team synergy are the keys
            to triumph.

            'ARAM' (All Random All Mid) simplifies the League of Legends
            experience into a single lane of non-stop action. It's a 5v5 mode
            where players are randomly assigned a champion. The relentless
            fighting tests your ability to make split-second decisions and
            teamfight effectively. With no respawns until your team is wiped,
            each move counts.

        'Summoner's Rift' in League of Legends consists of three lanes and the
        jungle. 'Top' lane is usually taken by resilient tanks or bruisers.
        'Mid' lane is often occupied by bursty mages or assassins. 'Bot' lane is
        generally shared by a damage-centric ADC and their supportive partner.
        The 'Jungle' is home to the Jungler, who focuses on neutral monster
        camps, helping lanes by 'ganking' (surprise attacking), and securing
        crucial map objectives.

        control; destroying them grants gold and advances your territory.
        'Inhibitors' spawn powerful minions when destroyed, aiding in sieges.
        'Dragon' and 'Baron Nashor' are major neutral monsters that grant
        significant team-wide buffs when defeated. 'Elder Dragon' and 'Baron
        Nashor' can especially become key late-game objectives, providing
        enhancements that can clinch victories.

        <h3>Take towers to assist your team with gold and power.</h3>
        <p>
          By coordinating with your team, using strategic positioning, and
          pushing minion waves, you can systematically take down enemy towers
          and gain map control. Destroying towers provides the team with gold,
          opens up the map, and creates opportunities to siege the enemy base,
          ultimately leading to victory.

          <p>
            In League of Legends, the Nexus is the ultimate objective and core
            building located at the heart of each team's base. It represents the
            key to victory in every match. The primary goal for players is to
            destroy the enemy Nexus while protecting their own. Once a team
            successfully takes down the enemy Nexus, they achieve victory in the
            game.

              This is a second semester exam project made by Emelie Krøger and
              Sofie Lysholm. We chose this theme for our website because we are
              big fans and also love to play this game. therefore it was fun for
              us to make this. We dont own any images and the game is made by
              Riot.
